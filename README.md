# Python Calculator

This Python project implements a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The user can continue performing calculations using the result of the previous calculation or start fresh.

## Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Allows users to continue calculations using the result of the previous operation.
- Clear and user-friendly interface with a calculator logo.

## How to use:
1. Run the program by executing the Python file.
2. The program will display a logo and prompt you for the first number.
3. Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) from the available options.
4. Enter the next number for the operation.
5. The result will be shown, and you'll be asked whether you'd like to continue with the result or start a new calculation.
6. You can type `'y'` to continue calculating with the result or `'n'` to start over.

## Example:
